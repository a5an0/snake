# snake

This is a little snake game that I hacked up to play with pyglet.

## Art Credits
* I took the brick image from http://opengameart.org/content/bricks-tiled-texture-64x64 and resized it to 32x32 using imagemagick for the wall sprite.
* The apple sprite came from http://opengameart.org/users/vandrake and then was resized to 32x32 using imagemagick
